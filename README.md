# DISCORD IT BOT

This discord bot is designed for entertainment purposes on my University's discord server. 
It offers features such as generating your own meme by writing on pictures, calculating probability, answering questions and many more. It is a multilingual bot, including English and Turkish

I have used [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [textwrap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html) as important and additional libraries while creating this bot. In the future, maybe I can do something like switch the whole system to [hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) instead of discord.py
